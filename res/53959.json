You'll play a role in shaping our product and our culture.The work I did was real work, not intern-pet-projects, not endless low priority bug-fixes, but important things, things that required trust, support, that were challenging, and that were needed for Hootsuite and their users.- John Giannakos, September to January 2014Our motto is learning happens in production. We practice continuous delivery, and ship new code to production multiple times each day in order to test hypotheses about our changes. We value autonomy, curiosity, and entrepreneurialism.

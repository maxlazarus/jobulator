Working out of EA Canada (EAC Burnaby) and Tiburon (Orlando, FL) studios, the EA Studios Technology Online group provides reliable and scalable core online technology for EA to create great online experiences that drive customer loyalty, ever-increasing usage, and cross-platform capabilities. It is all about developing online features, providing an interface to the lower level tech and providing a leading-edge EA proprietary SDK for game teams to easily add, customize and enhance online in their game.About EAIt’s not easy building the world’s best digital playground. It’s hair-standing-up-on-end-exhilarating. It’s down-in-the-trenches-challenging. Its stroke-of-brilliance-at-midnight creative. It’s you—taking risks, challenging yourself, pursuing ideas, changing the way millions of people do something they love: Play. We’re EA—we’ve been making games for decades but you wouldn’t know that walking through our studios. We’re still buzzing with the same innovative spirit we began with, though we’ve learned enough to earn our rank as a leading developer, publisher and distributor of the world’s best games. What began as a small group of people determined to “put real life in a box” has become an 8,000-people strong, worldwide organization delivering on that very dream. If you’ve played The Sims lately, you know exactly what we mean. And if you’ve played Battlefield 4, maybe you’d say that we’ve done real life one better.Whether you’re building Springfield on your mobile or your palms are sweaty from clutching your controller during intense games of FIFA 15, chances are you’ve played an EA game. And if you haven’t, well, what are you waiting for? In an industry that’s changing every day—whether it’s through new social channels, advancing technology, new audiences or unique opportunities for monetization—EA is positioned for growth thanks to smart business plans, strategic acquisitions, and most importantly, our creative people around the world who gather each day to unite the world through play. We take that last part very seriously, so if what you’re reading excites you as much as it does us, we invite you to get to know us better.",
